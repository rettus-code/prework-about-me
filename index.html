      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Retired from the Navy in 2018 and began going to school for 
        a computer science degree. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in the Southwest, mostly in Southern California.
        I consider Washington home now, and love being on Whidbey Island.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Travelling and trying exotic new foods. Socializing and cooking 
        while hosting events for friends. Some PC gaming and a bit of 
        table top, but I tend to be pretty picky and only like a few games.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I want to continue travelling so the first thing I'm looking for 
        is to work remotely, preferrably in web development but any software
        development is fine.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Oak Harbor Washington</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The freedom it offers I could potentially do freelance work or
        short or long term contracts, or maybe work full time for the right
        business. I'd like to help small businesses in my community and 
        obscure places I travel to increase their web presence so others 
        could explore the less mundane and what's beyond Amazon.</p>
